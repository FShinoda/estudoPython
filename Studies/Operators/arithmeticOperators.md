# Arithmetic Operators

Those are the basics operations. It can be used to manipulate values or variables.

## Addition:

- **`+`** ----> used to add a number to another ----> _ex:_ `2+2 = 4`


## Subtraction:

- **`-`** ----> used to add a number to another ----> _ex:_ `6-2 = 4`


## Multiplication:

- **`*`** ----> used to multiply a number to another ----> _ex:_ `6-2 = 4`


## Division:

- **`/`** ----> used to divide a number by other, but returning a float number --> _ex:_ `4/2 = 2.0`

- **`//`** ---> used to divide a number by other too. However, returning a integer --> _ex:_ `11//3 = 3`

- **`%`** ---> the percent symbol is used to return the remainder of the divide operation between the given numbers --> _ex:_ `11%3 = 2`


## Exponentiation:

- **`**`** ----> used to multiply a number to another ----> _ex:_ `2**3 = 8`
